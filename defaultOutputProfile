# This file defines the output color profile the program uses by default.
# The program does not actually reference this file; the defaults are
# contained within the program itself. This file is a sample of the output profile format.
# Custom output color profiles should use this format.
# Lines beginning with '#' or containing only whitepsace are ignored.
# Any other line should have the form <Category>:(<R>, <G>, <B>)
# <Category> should be a KÃ¶ppen-Geiger climate category, or 'Ocean'.
# <R>, <G> and <B> should be integers in the range 0-255, representing the red,
# green and blue values respectively for the output color that will correspond with
# the stated category.
# All of the climate categories in the sample below must be present in an output profile,
# although different categories can share output colors in which case they will be 
# indistinguishable in the output. The default profile below does this with the As/Aw,
# Csb/Cwb, and Cwb/Cwc categories.
